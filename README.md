## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Plugin not showing up?**  
- Make sure the ZIP file is placed directly inside the `/sdcard/Aliucord/plugins/` folder (not inside a subfolder).  
- Confirm the ZIP contains `plugin.json` at its root and is properly structured.  
- Ensure Aliucord has permission to access your device storage. Check Android app permissions under Settings.  
- Try restarting Aliucord or your device, then reload plugins again.  

- **Plugin not working as expected?**  
- Check that you are using the latest version of Aliucord.  
- Verify the plugin version matches your Aliucord version for compatibility.  
- If issues persist, try removing and reinstalling the plugin ZIP.
